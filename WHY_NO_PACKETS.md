# Why Are No Packets Being Sniffed?

## Current Status

Your sniffer is **running correctly** but capturing **0 packets**. Here's what the logs show:

```
‚úÖ Npcap service: RUNNING
‚úÖ Interface selected: Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX200 160MHz
‚úÖ Capture started successfully
‚úÖ CSV file created (200 bytes = headers only)
‚ùå Total packets captured: 0
```

## Root Causes

### 1. **Administrator Privileges** (Most Likely)

Windows requires administrator/elevated privileges for raw packet capture.

**How to fix:**
```bash
# Close VS Code and reopen as Administrator:
1. Right-click VS Code icon
2. "Run as Administrator"
3. Open your project again
4. Run npm run dev
```

### 2. **No Network Traffic**

Your network interface was idle during the 10-second capture window.

**How to fix:**
- While capture is running, open these in another terminal/browser:
  ```bash
  ping google.com -n 20
  # OR browse multiple websites
  # OR download a large file
  ```

### 3. **Quick Test with Traffic**

I've created a test script that automatically generates traffic:

```bash
# Run this from Command Prompt AS ADMINISTRATOR:
cd "C:\Users\shish\Documents\main projects\network-dataset-fullstack\assets\Network-Dataset-Generator"
test_with_traffic.bat
```

This will:
1. Start packet capture
2. Ping Google 10 times (generates traffic)
3. Show you the captured packets

## Expected Results When Working

When packets ARE being captured, you'll see:

```
[SNIFFER] Starting packet capture...
[1] IPv4 | 192.168.1.5 -> 8.8.8.8 | Size: 60 bytes | Rate: 5.0 pps | Total captured: 1
[2] IPv4 | 8.8.8.8 -> 192.168.1.5 | Size: 60 bytes | Rate: 5.0 pps | Total captured: 2
[5] IPv4 | 192.168.1.5 -> 142.250.185.78 | Size: 1460 bytes | Rate: 8.5 pps | Total captured: 10
=== Milestone: 100 packets processed ===
```

## Next Steps

1. **Close VS Code completely**
2. **Right-click VS Code ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"**
3. **Reopen your project**
4. **Start the dev server:** `npm run dev`
5. **Start a capture in the web UI**
6. **In another window, generate traffic:**
   - Open your browser and visit multiple websites
   - OR run: `ping google.com -n 50`
   - OR download a file

## Verification

Check the logs in your terminal where `npm run dev` is running. You should see:

```
[SNIFFER] Total packets captured: 142    ‚Üê Success!
[SNIFFER] Packets processed: 138
[SNIFFER] Success rate: 97.2%
```

Instead of:

```
[SNIFFER] Total packets captured: 0      ‚Üê Problem!
```

**Bottom line:** Run as Administrator + Generate traffic = Packets captured! üéØ
